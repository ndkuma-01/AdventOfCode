#Advent of Code

The following repository is my solutions for Advent of Code
The main folder structure (inside '\src') is split into three different folders:
- inputs
- javafiles
- Utilities

inputs stores all of the inputs.
To feed your own inputs replace the input file with yours and change the file structure so it resembles your own in the "\src\Utilities\General\GETINPUTS" line 28.
In addition you can also try fetching your input by retrieving your session cookies in the Advent of Code input, and paste it into the GETINPUTs file. This will require you
to manually change the Getinputs lines of code for each problem to fetch the input rather than grab it. (Fetching -> retrieve via HTTTP request, Get -> grab from input text file)

the javafiles holds all of the solutions


the utilities file holds all of the general utiliies used throughout all of the problems and some helper classes and records used throughout each of the years


When running a solution the day and time taken to run each of the parts will be displayed. Both parts to a day are contained in a single file with the template "AoC" + dayNum + ".java"

Hope you find the solutions interesting and helpful!!!
